title:  "The Basics: #3 The Emergency Fund"
---

Oh no! The car won’t start. The washing machine died. A leak has ruined a
bathroom cabinet.

You have two crises: get the car fixed, a new washing machine AND find the
money to cover it.

Of course, you can put it on your credit card and pay it off over 6 months—or
longer. Along with all that interest that you could have used on other
financial concerns.

Or, you can have an emergency fund—a relatively small one of $1000. 

Now you have only 1 crisis: get it fixed/replaced. No wondering where the
money is.

Then quickly repay the emergency fund.

In time you can add to that emergency fund for bigger emergencies—like losing
your job. But until you are out of debt $1000 brings security and hope.

Simple. But freeing.
