title:  "The Basics: #2 Budget Living"
---
Congratulations! You created your first budget. But reality just hit.

Now you have to live on it! That is the goal—and usually it takes a while to
hit the bull’s eye.

My experience is that it takes on average 3 months. Some take longer; few do
it shorter.

But whatever it takes, it is worth it. Remember freedom is waiting for you.

And it is your budget—put in it whatever you think is important, necessary,
prudent, helpful. Then live on it.

And when you live on your budget you create discipline—financial
discipline—that pays huge benefits as time goes on—like not living paycheck to
paycheck. And retiring so you see the inside of a WalMart when you are
shopping—not welcoming.

That is real freedom!
