title:  "The Basics: #4 Staring Debt In the Face"

They are on your desk, table. All those statements from credit cards, student
loans, car loans screaming for attention. 

Now!

Even this can be brought under control through budgeting and discipline—but you
got to grab the debt by the neck and squeeze. Hard!

Debt brings slavery—to you. Not freedom.

Think what you could do with the money you are paying in interest. It is a
potential goldmine.

But fear keeps many from tackling their debt. A plan to handle it removes the
fear and gets you out of slavery.

The plan is simple and works extremely well. Pay off your debt from the
smallest to the greatest. Keep rolling your payments over as debts are
eliminated.

With each debt conquered freedom starts to emerge. 

You can do it. You just have to start.

Today.
