title:  "The Basics: #1 Budgeting"
---
It has to be done, without fail—otherwise we wonder where the money went! 

I know—no one likes the word let alone the concept. But consider this: major
companies do it; small companies do it; even the government does it (they
just don’t keep to it!)

So, if successful companies budget, why shouldn’t you. It isn’t that hard to
do, though it may be hard to live out. But, disciplined people can create and
    live on a budget. It does not need to be a strait jacket.

In my experience as a coach I have heard no end of people say after they have
budgeted for as little as 3 months: “I did not know I made so much money!”
Or, “It is like I got a pay raise.”

Instead of feeling constrained, they actually find freedom. Money becomes
their slave—not their master.

Ramsey teaches a unique kind of budget called “zero-based.” It means every
dollar you make for the coming month has a name on it before you spend the
money. It is not hard to learn.

And once you budget consistently and then live on it freedom comes.

It is fun to live in freedom.
