  <h1>Let me help you secure your financial future.</h1>

  <p>
    Tired of living pay check to pay check? Wonder where your money is going? I
    want to be your financial coach. I only provide adviceâ€”no insurance, no
    investments, no get rich quick schemes. Review my philosophy of coaching
    and my credentials for being a coach (clickable links for both of these).
    Your financial well-being is my only concern. Look at the different
    services that I offer. Then contact me for my inexpensive pricing
    structure. We can meet in person, by phone or through Skype to get you on
    the road to financial freedom.
