You are the owner of a professional football team. I want to be your head coach. My job will be to advise you on what is best for your situation. Since I sell no products or receive any kickbacks from anyone, I am free to advise as I see fit.

You will also need an offensive coach (investments), a defensive coach (insurance), and a special teams coach (will or trust.) I can recommend people in each area, but it is up to you to decide if you want to use them. (Regardless of what you do, I receive no kickback.)

At our first meeting I would review your total financial picture. Then, I would offer my advice on what is the biggest issue you are facing and show you how to tackle that issue. At the end of the first session, since you are the owner, you can decide if you want to retain me or let me go.

So, because I am independent you receive the best, unbiased advice. My advice is based upon the tried and proven principles of Dave Ramsey. (I have been trained by Ramsey to coach, led many Financial Peace University classes, and have coached for more than four years.) Over two million people have worked Ramsey’s plan and have found financial stability. You can do the same!

By putting into practice what Dave Ramsey teaches you recover my fee. And the savings are usually immediate. So, whether your need is crisis intervention, budgeting, debt elimination, wealth building or real estate I can help your financial football team win.

Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired about your finances? Then let’s do something about it. Let’s look toward the future and not dwell in the past. Let’s become proactive so you do not have to live from one paycheck to the next.

Are you ready to take the first step?  We can discuss my pricing and our first meeting. Contact me [here](mailto:budgetcoachcurt@aol.com).
